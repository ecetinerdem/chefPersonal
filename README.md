This is a single page professional web-site for showing Melek Erdem's(my sister) CV. It is html and css based with a little bit of JS. Contact form functions and sends ema≈ül as well. I am mostly focusing on learning back-end but needed to learn more html and css for this project.

I will launch the page after finalizing. until then video can help to see how it works.

Feel free to have it!
